# Sentiment Tweet Analysis Challenge

This repository is in response to Siraj's youtube/github challenge.
[Sentiment Analysis Challenge](https://github.com/llSourcell/twitter_sentiment_challenge)

The script will search for a keyword in tweets and run sentiment analysis to determine the emotion of the tweet's content.

The results will write to a small csv file for analysis based on the phrase _"Mondays"_ -- because everyone loves Mondays!!

The python modules used:

- **Numpy**
- **TextBlob**
- **Tweepy**Ã¥

Note: must have twitter API credentials to run the python script
